## Neural Network for Covid Detection

The intention of this project was to understand and apply all my theorical knowledge in Convolutional Neural Networks but it turn into a competition between my biomedical engineer friend and me. 

The objective was to build a Neural Network for Covid detection using the data from lung radiographies, and the winner will be the model with the best categorical metrics.

# [Project 5: Hackathon 2020](https://github.com/edco17/Hackathon-2020)

All the rigths are for Grupo Modelo, and the intellectual authors are Edgar Cardoso and Ian Perrilliat

## Objective

The main purpose of this project was to found six distribution areas, this areas must have the clients with the shortest distance, same quantity of clients and same quantity of product distribution.

The problem was solve, with KMeans and forcing the areas to be the most equal in clients an products.

Here are some graphs for explaining the process.
