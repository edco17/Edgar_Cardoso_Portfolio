# Project 1: Coronavirus_Tweets
Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis project for tag all the coronavirus tweets.

The objective of this project was to apply all the NLP and Sentiment analysis knowledge that I learn with my coursera courses in the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, also this project helped me develope a Sentiment Analysis program to participate in the 2020 BBVA Hackathon (another project in this github).
