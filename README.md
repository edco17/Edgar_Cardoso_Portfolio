## Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis project for tag all the coronavirus tweets.

The objective of this project was to apply all the NLP and Sentiment analysis knowledge that I learn with my coursera courses in the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, also this project helped me develope a Sentiment Analysis program to participate in the 2020 BBVA Hackathon (another project in this github).

## Neural Network for Covid Detection

The intention of this project was to understand and apply all my theorical knowledge in Convolutional Neural Networks but it turn into a competition between my biomedical engineer friend and me. 

The objective was to build a Neural Network for Covid detection using the data from lung tomographies, and the winner will be the model with the best categorical metrics.
